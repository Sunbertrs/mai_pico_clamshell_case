# mai_pico_clamshell_case

A simple and concise housing case for mai_pico.

## Introduction

This project is a housing case for the project [whowechina/mai_pico](https://github.com/whowechina/mai_pico).

This project is highly depends on 3D printing and your budget, you may spend about ï¿¥300 on this.

There are some advantage if you use this housing case:

- Clamshell design for easy to open and access.

- No screws on the front side, looks well.

- Use the materials that are left after making mai_pico.

- Four screws only need to install.

- Easy to set the background of the top frame, and able to replace it at any time.

## Disclaimer

This project has no relationship to S... company.

I'm new to model design, please bear with me and let me know if some of the designs will cause problems.

I'm not sure if there is better way to make this housing case out. If there is, feel free to tell me via an issue.

3D print can be rough, I won't answer for any issues caused by the quality of 3D printing.

## How to build

1. Download all the files in `./Production/` folder.

2. Print `front-panel.step` `back-panel.step` using 3D printer, but to make sure the printer can print up to 410mm. Search 3D printing on online shopping platforms, some merchants can print large size. And seach acrylic customization, send the file `head-cover.step` to merchant and ask if they can make.
  - In addition, you can design a border background for the head screen. I made a diagram `border-size.png` to show you the size of the border.

4. Cover the front panel, and you can see some grooves on you left side. Put a steel shaft in the wider groove then push it through the round hole. Another groove do so.

5. Make sure to disconnect the zebra cable from ITO coated glass and the IO PCB (you can simply separate them with a hair dryer). Place your PCB on the back panel with the front side of the PCB facing up. Each hole on the PCB should be aligned with the four posts on the back panel. Then, install a screw on each hole.
  - If you also added a PN532 module, you can place it in the reserved slot blow.

6. On the side of front panel you can find a gap. Push your glass into the gap, and you will see the gold finger on the glass appeared in the groove on the other side, now you can stick the zebra cable again.

7. On the front panel you can find some bumps surround the circle, they fits your button ring. Apply some double-sided tapes to appropriate position around the circle, and put the leading wires into the hole on the left. Tear off the double-sided adhesive stickers, put the button ring in place, and organize the wires in the back.

8. On the upper side of the front panel, align the bottom of the acrylic to the groove and put it in, then close the upper part and fix it with steel shafts on the back.
